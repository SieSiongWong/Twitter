Can a S&P 500 trading strategy take advantage of President Trumpâ€™s trade-related tweets and predict short-term moves in the market? I turned to topic modeling and sentiment analysis to find out. The general project design and workflow is as follows:
1) Data Collection and Preprocessing: raw tweets were collected and preprocessed to pass on tokenized and lemmatized words to the topic model.
2) Topic Modeling with LDA: topic modeling was utilized to assign each tweet a topic. Only tweets related to the trade topic were passed along for sentiment analysis.
3) Sentiment Analysis with VADER: after identifying tweets related to trade, each tweet was assigned a sentiment score. Sentiment scores were passed along as the core input to the trading strategy.
4) Backtesting Trading Strategy on S&P 500 Data: once sentiment scores were assigned, a custom trading strategy was designed to trade on significant sentiment scores.



```{r}
# Load stock data files and Tweets from Trump 
# Step 1 of flows above. 
library(stringr)
#?readLines
snp_raw <- read.csv("sandp.csv", header = TRUE)
typeof(snp_raw)
snp_raw[2,]
tweets_raw <- read.csv("trumptweets.csv", header = TRUE)
typeof(tweets_raw)
tweets_raw[3,]
```
